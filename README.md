# Deep Learning Nanodegree Udacity - Projects
> This repository contains projects that were submitted as a part of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program.


## Code and Resources Used
- **Python Version:** 3.7
- **Packages:** numpy, pandas, matplotlib
- **Deep Learning Nanodegree Program, Udacity:** https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101


## Projects
###Completed
- **Predict Bike-Sharing Patterns**: Build a neural network in NumPy to predict bike-sharing rides.

###To be completed:
- **Landmark Classification & Tagging for Social Media:** Build a CNN with PyTorch to classify landmarks.
- **TV Script Generation:** Build recurrent networks and long short-term memory networks with PyTorch; perform sentiment
analysis and use recurrent networks to generate new text from TV scripts.
- **Face Generation:** Use a Deep Convolutional GAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.
- **Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model:** deploy a PyTorch sentiment analysis model using Amazon SageMaker on AWS.
